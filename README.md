## Introduction
This is the repo for the Exercise: Infrastructure and Code for an API Endpoint. I originally started with pure lambda and then it got more and more complex.

## Components
There are 3 versions here. Each have their own README that will go into more detail.
* [Lambda Version](lambda-version/README.md) - fully automated but no container image
* [ECR Version](ecr-lambda-version/README.md) - requires some manual process with the image push
* [Kubernetes Version](k8s-version/README.md) - requires some manual process along with kubectl
